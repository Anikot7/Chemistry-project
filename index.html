        <h1>The Bohr Atomic Model</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Bohr model of the atom, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure. It describes the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in defined circular orbits. This model was a significant advancement in the field of quantum mechanics, as it introduced the idea that electrons exist in specific energy levels rather than in arbitrary positions around the nucleus.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantized Energy Levels:</strong> Electrons can only occupy certain energy levels, which are quantized. This means that they can only exist at specific distances from the nucleus, corresponding to specific energy values.</li>
            <li><strong>Emission and Absorption of Energy:</strong> When an electron transitions between energy levels, it either absorbs or emits energy in the form of photons. This process is responsible for the spectral lines observed in atomic emission and absorption spectra.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrogen Spectrum:</strong> The Bohr model successfully explains the emission spectrum of hydrogen, where distinct lines correspond to transitions between energy levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>The Bohr model was groundbreaking as it introduced the concept of quantized energy levels, which laid the foundation for modern quantum physics. It provided a clearer understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of electrons, influencing subsequent theories and models in atomic physics. While the Bohr model has limitations, such as its inability to accurately predict the spectra of more complex atoms, it remains a crucial step in the evolution of atomic theory.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Bohr model paved the way for the development of quantum mechanics, as it highlighted the need for a new way of thinking about atomic behavior. The model's success in explaining the hydrogen atom's spectrum led to further research and the formulation of more advanced theories, including the Schr√∂dinger equation and quantum mechanics as we know it today.</p>
        <p>In educational contexts, the Bohr model serves as an essential teaching tool, providing students with a visual and conceptual framework for understanding atomic structure. Despite its simplifications, it effectively illustrates key concepts such as energy quantization and electron transitions, making it an enduring part of physics education.</p>
